### 6. Medical Disclaimer - **CRITICAL** ‚ùå
**Status:** Missing  
**Priority:** Critical - FDA Compliance

**Why This Matters:**
Your app tracks pregnancy health data. To avoid FDA regulation as a medical device, you MUST:

**Required Disclaimers:**

1. **In-App (First Launch):**
```
"Corgina is a wellness tracker and is not intended to diagnose, 
treat, cure, or prevent any disease or medical condition. 
Always consult your healthcare provider for medical advice."
```

2. **App Store Description:**
Add to the end of description:
```
IMPORTANT: This app is for informational and tracking purposes 
only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice. 
Consult your doctor for medical guidance.
```

3. **In the App (Settings or About):**
Add a disclaimer screen accessible from settings

**How to Fix:**
1. Add disclaimer to `ContentView.swift` on first launch
2. Store flag in UserDefaults to show only once
3. Add to App Store description
4. Add to app settings/about section

**Why:**
- Apps providing general wellness tracking (not diagnosis/treatment) are exempt from FDA regulation
- Clear disclaimers demonstrate this intent
- Protects from medical device classification
