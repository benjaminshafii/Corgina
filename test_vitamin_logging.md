# Vitamin Logging Test Instructions

## Setup
1. Open the app in Xcode
2. Run on simulator or device
3. Make sure you have your OpenAI API key configured in Settings

## Test Cases

### Test 1: Basic Vitamin Logging
1. Go to Dashboard or tap the microphone button
2. Say: "I took my prenatal vitamin"
3. **Expected**: 
   - Voice should be transcribed
   - Action detected: "Log vitamin: prenatal vitamin"
   - Vitamin logged to supplements
   - Entry appears in activity log

### Test 2: Multiple Vitamins
1. Tap microphone
2. Say: "I took my prenatal and iron supplements"
3. **Expected**: 
   - Both vitamins should be detected
   - Both logged separately

### Test 3: Common Variations
Try these phrases:
- "I took my vitamins"
- "I had my prenatal"
- "I took my iron tablet"
- "I took my DHA"
- "I took my calcium supplement"
- "I took my folic acid"

### Test 4: Auto-Add Feature
1. Say a vitamin that's not in your list (e.g., "I took my vitamin D")
2. **Expected**:
   - System should auto-add the vitamin
   - Log the intake
   - Show in supplements list

## What Was Fixed

### 1. VoiceLogManager Fix
- Fixed vitamin name extraction (was looking for `item` instead of `vitaminName`)
- Added logging to activity feed for visibility
- Added debug logging to track processing

### 2. SupplementManager Enhancement
- Improved name matching (more flexible)
- Auto-adds common vitamins if not found
- Better handling of variations ("prenatal" vs "prenatal vitamin")

### 3. LogEntry Support
- Added `supplement` type to LogType enum
- Added `supplementName` field
- Added green color and pill icon for supplements

### 4. OpenAI Prompt Improvement
- Better recognition of vitamin-related phrases
- Examples of common variations
- Support for multiple vitamins in one command

## Debugging
If vitamins aren't logging:
1. Check console output for:
   - "ðŸ’Š VoiceLogManager: Processing vitamin action"
   - "ðŸ’Š Found supplement match"
   - "ðŸ’Š Vitamin logged successfully"

2. Verify supplements are configured in More > Vitamins & Supplements

3. Check that VoiceLogManager is properly configured with managers
